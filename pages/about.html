    <h1>What is Learn to Read Arabic by Short Stories about?</h1>

    <p>This program assumes that you have a rudimentary knowledge of Arabic. Meaning, you know the Arabic Alphabet, you can read Arabic at a basic level, and know a few words.</p>
  
    <p>The main purpose of the program is to gradually introduce the reader to new vocabulary over time using short stories. Eventually, the user should be able to read an Arabic news paper with ease.</p>
  
    <p>Depending on how you do the counting, the Arabic language has anywhere from 100,000 to 12.3 million words. Yes 12.3 million</p>
  
    <p>However, don't let that discourage you. It is estimated that a knowledge of 1000 to 3000 words is enough for casual conversations in most languages.</p>
  
    <p>While knowing 10,000 to 15,000 words is enough for most advanced activities, including reading a newspaper.</p>
  
    <p>We plan on extending the program to include local dialects. However, the program is currently focused on Modern Standard Arabic at the moment.</p>
